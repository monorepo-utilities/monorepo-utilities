## Arguments

- **`<dir>`**: a string containg a directory name within a monorepo

## Why

When using various project managers for monorepos, like [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), package building can be difficult to run asynchronously **or** based on package dependencies.

Listing out packages by directory can assist is decoupling package building.

## Benefits

Listed below are a few benefits to using **list-packages-by-directory**.

- Build control
- Build and testing convenience

## Use Case

Consider the following paragraphs to decide whether **list-packages-by-directory** can assist your project!

### Building AND Testing Monorepo Woos

Monorepo packages are **not** the same!

When initially looking at monorepos, it is easy to imagine building small re-usable chunks of code to be used _interdependently in a project. See [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) code for _[reference](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/main/utils/check-working-tree/package.json#L33). OR, also, monorepos can be used as a uniform system of code chunks to be used in projects to construct the project *outputs in a uniform way. *See [@rollup/plugins](https://github.com/rollup/plugins) for reference.

However, monorepos can provide a whole other level of power when packages are not built to perform a similar purpose. Consider, [Readwoodjs](https://redwoodjs.com/) for [reference](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction.html#how-it-works). Monorepos can provides team power by interconnectivity! If carefully considered, monorepos can include...

### How install-dependencies helps

Here's a short list of how **list-packages-by-directory** helps!

- **install-dependencies** installs all dependencies specific to a config (a `package.json`)'s dependencies.
- **install-dependencies** will optionally ignore dependencies specified in a config (a `package.json`)'s `installDependencies.ignore` array.
- **install-dependencies** will optionally override dependencies or add dependencies specified in a config (a `package.json`)'s `installDependencies.include` object.
