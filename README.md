## Glossary

Below are sectioned descriptions and usages of each implemented Monorepo Utility.

[Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies)

### Install Dependencies

**[Install Dependencies](/packages/install-dependencies) ðŸ“¦** is a function which assists in building dependencies (`node_modules`) to a specified path.

#### Usage

```javascript
install-dependencies <path>
// => installs <node_modules> to a specified path
```

### Why

When using various project managers for monorepos, like yarn workspaces and lerna, there are drawbacks in the DX (Developer Experience) versus deployment experience of module installation.
By manually providing a way to specifically install `node_modules` to a specified location, developors can enjoy module hoisting and local package referencing and **not** have to worry about what's in `node_modules` folders when deploying un-bundled node apps.
