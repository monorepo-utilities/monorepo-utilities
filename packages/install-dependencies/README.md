## Why

When using various project managers for monorepos, like yarn workspaces and lerna, there are drawbacks in the DX (Developer Experience) vs deployment experience of module installation.
By manually providing a way to specifically install `node_modules` to a specified location, developors can enjoy module hoisting and local package referencing and **not** have to worry about what's in `node_modules` folders when deploying un-bundled node apps.
