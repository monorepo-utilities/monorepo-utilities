Build `node_modules` to spec. ðŸ‘Œ

---

When working with [monorepos](), particularly when using [yarn workspaces](), it is common to require building dependencies **exactly** as listed within a `package.json`. That's examctly what **build node modules does**!

**build node modules does** builds node_modules directly from `package.json` exactly as specified. No building with hoisted packages! No bloat! Just a simple dependencies install!

However, if desired you, specify package versions and packages can be specified with in the build!
